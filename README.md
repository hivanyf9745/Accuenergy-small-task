# Accuenergy-small-task

Hello!

My name is Ivan, a recent-graduate 👨🏻‍🎓 from McGill University who has been majored in data science and web development 👨🏻‍💻.

Upon request, I was asked to create a small Vue.js application as a coding assessment by Accuenergy 🔋.

**In the next section, I will list out the features of this Vue Application and what you need to do to run this web app on your local environment.**

1. First you can either: **download the zip file** or **running `git clone`** to install the applications.

   > For those who are running git clone, you need to follow the following steps

   - `cd` to the directory that you want to store your files
   - Then, `cd component-based-frontend`
   - Run `npm install` or `npm i` to install the node modules (**This step is vitally important since without node modules, you cannot run the `.vue` files in local environment**)
   - Finally, run `npm run dev` in your terminal of your IDE

2. After you run the `npm run dev`, you will see something like this:

```

VITE v4.3.8 ready in 342 ms

-> Local:   http://localhost:5173/
-> Network: use --host to expose
-> press h to show help
```

**You will need to go to `http://localhost:5173/` to view the full application**

3. It looks like everything is ready. However, you will need one final touch to go through the application smoothly:
   - Remember to **Allow the browser to give location access to this url**. Otherwise, your google maps will not show up!

### That's all! Enjoy hacking! 😈
